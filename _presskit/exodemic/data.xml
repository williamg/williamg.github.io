  <description>Destroy aliens, dash between planets, and buy powerful upgrades. Exodemic is a compact roguelike that combines frenetic shoot 'em up gameplay with a procedurally generated overworld filled with vendors, trading hubs, and combat encounters. Race against the clock to save the human race.

  <history>I started working on Exodemic in June 2021 with the goal being to finally finish a game after years of starting games. I originally thought I could complete the game in a few months, but it ended up taking almost exactly a year working on it every night in between being a full time software developer and full time dad.</history>
