Last year while I was looking at perspective colleges, and even once I had decided
on CMU, I was very interested in the student perspective; what it's like to actually
*be* a student at Carnegie Mellon. Surprisingly, there was very little available
aside from the standard student life page on each university's website. Seeing
as I've noe completed roughly a semester and a half now, I thought I'd go ahead
and contribute for any prospective students like me.

## About Me

Since a significant portion of the post will be subjective, my background is probably
relevant as it definitely shapes my expectations and opinions of things. First
things first, I'm a freshman studying computer science. Before college, I spent
three years at [The Louisiana School for Math, Science, and the Arts]("http://lsmsa.edu")
a pubilc school for high-achieving highschoolers in Louisiana. LSMSA is actually
situated on a college campus, and most of the classes are taught by college
professors at a college level; about 90% of my teachers had a terminal degree
in their field of study. That said, I had already experienced a lot of what
is often lumped into the "college experience." Namely, I had spent three years
living relatively independently, I was being taught at a college level, and I was
being exposed to a truly diverse group of people; much more than an average
highschool. I point this out mainly because these are all aspects which may
have a significant impact on one's college epxerience, but they weren't for me,
so I probably won't talk about them as much. Additionally, I'm one of the most
introverted people you'll ever meet (if you ever meet me..) so I can't comment
much on the soial scene at CMU either.

## First Impressions

As a freshman, you'll first real look at CMU will be during orientation week.
I mean sure, those summer tours are great, but they don't really give you a feel
for the campus and student body. First things first, you have to move in. I must
say, the orientation staff make this absolutely painless. I got out of my car, 
they told me to go do some logistical things like get my ID and some CMU swag,
and by the time I got back my stuff was already at the door of my room...on the
third floor. Already, I'm digging this place. The week continued pretty much
as expected, awkward ice breakers, cool performances and shows, crowded meals, 
and lots of walking. As an introvert, a lot of the week was uncomfortable for me;
I suspect that that's the case for a lot of CMU students, especially computer science
majors. I didn't really end up with a close-knit group of friends like many people
seemed to; however, that's not for lack of opportunities, and probably more
for lack of me trying/knowing how.

After orientation, I got my first experience of real college life. A few classes,
surprisingly not terrible food, and a pretty substantial amount of homework.
My first class was Matter and Interactions I, which is described as the "Honors Physics"
course at CMU. I felt compelled to take this course for a variety of reasons.
First of all, without it I would have been carrying "only" 40 units of classes.
(For a freshman, the maximum is 55 and the minimum is like 35, I think) Despite
having been accepted into one of the most prestigious schools in the world, while
I was scheduling my classes I for some reason still felt the need to "prove" myself.
To justify my presence. I thought that the best way to do this was to take
as many hard classes as I possibly could. Within about two weeks, I gravely
regretted my deecision. One of hte most dangerous traps that I fell into during
that first semester (and still do to this day) is making the assumption that
because my computer science classes are super hard (and they are), all of my
other classes are super easy. (and they aren't) Matter and Interactions kicked
my ass and the ass of just about everyone else in that class. It was hard, and
it took up a LOT of my time. And the worst part? I don't think it really even matters.
I mean, I'm not a physics major, I have no intention of getting a degree in physics.
I could have taken the intro physics class and my graduation requirement would
have been just as fulfilled, and I would have had more time to spend doing things
that DID matter, like my CS classes, side projects, and research. More on that later...

# The Grind
Eventually, I got into the groove of things and developed a pretty routine schedule.
I had class every day til about mid-afternoon, went to Gates and watched Netflix until
5, grabbed dinner, worked on any homework due the next day, played video games,
and went to sleep. On the weekends, I spent my Saturday afternoons playing video games
and my Satudray nights (about 8pm-1am) working on problem sets because I honestly
didn't have anything better to do. Typically I could finish about half of my week's
work on Saturday nights. On Sundays I went to my research meeting and worked on that
for a few hours, then worked on homework until a meeting for the FSAE team at 6:30,
before having dinner, going to mass, and going to bed. This was how just about every
week played out. Hoenstly, it wasn't that bad, aside from the inevitable frustration
over my math assignment, I was pretty satisfied. But it wasn't all work and no
play; I've already alluded to some of the many perks that come with being a student
at Carnegie Mellon...especailly a computer science student.
