Imposter syndrome: an individual's belief, despite evidence to the contrary, that
one does no deserve the success they have achieved

- Increasingly prevalent especially in rigorous, challenging environments (like CMU!)
- Personal experiences
	- Acceptance (wow I wonder who messed up...)
	- Freshman year
		- Struggling with work load/etc. despite evidence that it comes naturally to peers
		- 251. Nuff said.
		- Working on rovers
		- Jobs/interviews
- Dealing with it
	- Recognition that LOTS of people feel this way
		- No one knows what going on. Everyone is faking it.
	- Really try to internalize accomplishments
		- It's not pride
- You're not alone. You're not a fraud.
