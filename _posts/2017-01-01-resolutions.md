I've never really been one for New Year's resolutions. Part of it is probably
that I've always been fairly comfortable and complacent with my life that
making any drastic changes has seemed entirely too inconvenient. As you've
probably surmised from the title, I've had a change of heart. My hope is that
by writing them down, even if no one else reads them, I might feel a tiny bit
more obligated to stick to them. Hopefully, in 365 days I'll have a new post
to say that I actually completed them all.

## 1. Write More
I've had this blog for quite a while now (3+ years) and I have 6 posts, including
this one. That's pretty pathetic. I think writing or at least keeping some sort
or journal is a fairly productive thing to do. Especially with respect to
technical aspects, I think writing about projects helps to review your work and
think about ways you could have done things better or differently. Assuming
someone reads what you write, it also provides a means of receiving feedback
which is invaluable. I think the most important consequence of writing about
projects is that it forces you to justify your decisions. The more detail you include, the
more you have to rationalize each decision you made. I hypothesize that this
will make me a more deliberate, careful developer since if I make bad decisions
I'll then have to tell the entire internet about how I made terrible design choices.

## 2. Develop and Launch a Game
Every two months or so for the past several years, I get an overwhelming desire
to develop a video game. This typically results in me coming up with a
half-baked idea, spending an inordinate amount of time to come up with a
clever name, spend about a week tops coding up a prototype without finishing and
then abandoning the project altogether. My goal for 2017 is that I actually
follow through on one of these projects and "finish" it. Besides just developing
a game, I want to maintain a devblog, promote the game on social media, and do
all the things a typical indie developer would do. I don't plan to go into gamedev
full-time any time soon, but I think there are a lot of skills that I can learn from
hobby gamedev that will help me in other aspects of my career. The gamedev bug
has bitten me again so I've currently got something in the works; with any luck,
the first entry of my devblog for that project will be out this week.

## 3. Read More
I've always vehemently abhorred reading. I don't know why. I found it tedious and
boring. I still do, but now I recognize that it's actually kind of a good thing
to do. Especially in the software development field, there is a ton of literature
written about how to become better at the craft. I'd like to read a few of these
books. At the top of my list are:

- [Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction, Second Edition](https://www.amazon.com/Code-Complete-Practical-Handbook-Construction/dp/0735619670/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1483332605&sr=1-1&keywords=code+complete)
- [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1483332589&sr=1-1&keywords=pragmatic+programmer)
- [The Mythical Man Month](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1483332575&sr=1-1&keywords=Mythical+man+month)
- [Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1483330346&sr=1-1&keywords=Clean+Code)

I'd also love any fiction suggestions to throw into the mix. I've read and loved
the entire "Hitchhiker's Guide" series by Douglas Adams.

## 4. Increase My Faith
2017 will be the first year in which I'm not a student, seeing as I'm graduating
in May (woohoo!). A consequence of this is that I'll no longer be held accountable
by others (e.g. religious educators, FOCUS missionaries) with respect to my faith.
It will be completely up to me to nurture and increase it. My goal for 2017 is to
accomplish this. The exact method isn't clear, but I know I want to grow
closer to Christ and He wants to grow closer to me.

So that's it. My four resolutions for 2017. Feel free to hold me accountable on
Twitter ([@ganashaw](https://twitter.com/ganashaw)). Hopefully, I'll be back in
a couple days with a devblog for my latest project.
